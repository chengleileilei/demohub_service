# Stable Diffusion Img2Img
&emsp;&emsp;Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model. Similar to Google's Imagen, this model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.
