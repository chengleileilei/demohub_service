# Faster R-CNN
&ensp;&ensp;Faster R-CNN is a target detection model proposed by Ren et al. of Microsoft Research Asia in 2015. The core idea of Faster R-CNN is to use the Region Proposal Network (Region Proposal Network) to generate candidate regions, and then use the Fast R-CNN network to classify and return these candidate regions.
