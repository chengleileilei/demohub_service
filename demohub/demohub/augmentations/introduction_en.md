# Augmentation
&ensp;&ensp;Image augmentation is a process of creating new training examples from the existing ones. To make a new sample, you slightly change the original image. For instance, you could make a new image a little brighter; you could cut a piece from the original image; you could make a new image by mirroring the original one, etc.
