# ResNet
&ensp;&ensp;ResNet is a deep neural network model proposed by He Kaiming and others from Microsoft Research Asia. The core idea of ResNet is to use the residual block (residual block) to build the network, which can make the network deeper without the problem of gradient disappearance. The ResNet model achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet dataset1.
