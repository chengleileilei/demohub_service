# EfficientNet
&ensp;&ensp;EfficientNet is a more efficient method proposed by Google Artificial Intelligence while improving existing technical achievements. It is an image classification model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), whose main feature is to greatly reduce the amount of computation and the number of parameters while maintaining accuracy. The core idea of the EfficientNet model is to use compound scaling factors to expand the network depth, width and resolution.

&ensp;&ensp;EfficientNet model includes eight versions B0-B7, where B0 is the smallest version and B7 is the largest version. The differences between these versions are their depth, width and resolution. B0 has the fewest parameters and the least amount of computation, while B7 has the most parameters and the largest amount of computation.
